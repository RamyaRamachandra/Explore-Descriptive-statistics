#### Introduction
Data professionals often use descriptive statistics to understand the data they are working with and provide collaborators with a summary of the relative location of values in the data, as well an information about its spread.

For this activity, you are a member of an analytics team for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). You are assigned to analyze data on air quality with respect to carbon monoxide, a major air pollutant. The data includes information from more than 200 sites, identified by state, county, city, and local site names. You will use Python functions to gather statistics about air quality, then share insights with stakeholders.
